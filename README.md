# Flutter App Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and run the Flutter app on your local machine or mobile devices.

---

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
1. [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (compatible version as per the app requirements).
2. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Android Emulator or a physical device (with USB Debugging enabled).
4. (Optional) [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS development (macOS only).

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the app's repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Fetch the required dependencies by running:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## Step 3: Run the App in Debug Mode

### For Android
1. Connect an Android device via USB or start an emulator.
2. Run the following command to launch the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### For iOS (macOS only)
1. Connect an iOS device or start a simulator.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

You can also use your IDEâ€™s "Run" or "Debug" button to start the app.

## Step 4: Build and Install in Release Mode
Release mode is optimized for performance and used for production builds.

### For Android
1. Build the release APK:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
2. Locate the APK file in the following directory:
   ```
   build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```
3. Install the APK on your device:
   ```bash
   adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

### For iOS (macOS only)
1. Build the release IPA:
   ```bash
   flutter build ipa --release
   ```
2. Locate the `.xcarchive` file in the build directory and open it in Xcode for signing and distribution.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure your system meets the [Flutter system requirements](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- If any dependencies are missing, run:
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  ```
  Follow the instructions to resolve issues.
- For troubleshooting and advanced configurations, refer to the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).
